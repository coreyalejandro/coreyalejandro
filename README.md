# Hi there! I'm **Corey Alejandro**!

![](https://i.imgur.com/0OZ8k4J.gif)


I am a full stack data scientist (and Machine Learning Engineer in-the-making) with a triple threat designer skillset in Instructional Design/Instructional Systems Design (ISD),  User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) Design and full stack Web Development and Design and Development (WeDev)â€” working at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), mental health, learning and developmment, affective commputing, and social and restorative justice.
<br>

I think of my GitHub pages as the backend to my website: [coreyalejandro.com](https://www.coreyalejandro.com). This is where all the magic (and mishaps) happen.

This page provides a general overview of my work. I used the GitHub organization feature to organize my work by **Discipline/Domain**.

I have a unique and extraordinary skillset that demonstrate a command of many today's most in-demand tools and **Skills**. The list ' represents only half of my skillset, as I have only inlcluded those in which I am proficient to advanced. My workimg knowledge skillset is much much longer.

I am constantly learning and leveling up my skills. The **Learning** sections features have included links to. Do to privacy and academic integrity not all of my work can be shown. I highlight those projects that I am most proud of, that are most challenging (and therefore might look a mess) or that I am intrigued by and can't let go of yet.

Thank you for taking the time to visit me here. If you have any questions or comments, please see the **Contact** section for all the various ways you can reach me.
