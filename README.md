# Hi there! I'm **Corey Alejandro**!

![](https://i.imgur.com/OUGOH49.gif)


I am a full stack data scientist (and Machine Learning Engineer in-the-making) with a triple threat designer skillset in Instructional Design/Instructional Systems Design (ISD),  User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) Design and full stack Web Development and Design and Development (WeDev)— working at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), mental health, learning and developmment, affective commputing, and social and restorative justice.
<br>

I think of my GitHub pages as the backend to my website: [coreyalejandro.com](https://www.coreyalejandro.com). This is where all the magic (and mishaps) happen.

This page provides a general overview of my work. I used the GitHub organization feature to organize my work by **Discipline/Domain**.

I have a unique and extraordinary skillset that demonstrate a command of many today's most in-demand tools and **Skills**. The list ' represents only half of my skillset, as I have only inlcluded those in which I am proficient to advanced. My workimg knowledge skillset is much much longer.

I am constantly learning and leveling up my skills. The **Learning** sections features have included links to. Do to privacy and academic integrity not all of my work can be shown. I highlight those projects that I am most proud of, that are most challenging (and therefore might look a mess) or that I am intrigued by and can't let go of yet.

Thank you for taking the time to visit me here. If you have any questions or comments, please see the **Contact** section for all the various ways you can reach me.
